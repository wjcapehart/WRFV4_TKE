directions for WRF users:
repair $the_path in wrf_prepare.pl
repair $dir_html in wrf.f2h
then:
wrf_prepare.pl
f90tohtml wrf.f2h

directions for ARPS users:
do as above, but substitute
arps for wrf, if using arps4.5.1
arps90 for wrf, if using arps5.0

directions for COAMPS users:
do as above, but substitute
coamps for wrf

NOTES:
If grep 'bfiedler' wrf_ls/*.ls
find any hits, then something went wrong with wrf_prepare.pl

There are duplicate subroutine names in WRF (e.g., for
different initializations).  v1.02 of f90tohtml now allows
for "commenting out" file names with # in the .ls files,
thus preventing f90tohtml from becoming confused.

wrf.f2h was configured for WRFV3 April 30, 2009
